### Hi there, I'm Curtis ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy building full-stack applications, and playing with machine learning. My go-to languages are JavaScript, Python, and C.

I'm working on three early-stage, side projects:
- [Another C Library](https://anotherlibrary.com)
- [Taskaholic](https://taskaholic.com)
- [Stonk Advisor](https://stonkadvisor.com)

You can find me various places on the interwebs:
- [CurtisCodes.com - My Windows98 Themed Portfolio](https://curtiscodes.com)
- [Twitter - @codescurtis](https://twitter.com/codescurtis)
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/dancurtis)
- [Email](mailto:contactdcurtis@gmail.com)

Occasionally, I write about programming on Dev.to:

Checkout [dont-readme](https://github.com/danielcurtis/dont-readme) to see how I built this.
