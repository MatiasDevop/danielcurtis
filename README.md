### Hi there, I'm Curtis 👋

I enjoy building full-stack applications, and playing with machine learning. My go-to languages are JavaScript, Python, and C.

I'm working on three early-stage, side projects:
- 📗 [Another C Library](https://anotherlibrary.com)
- ☑️ [Taskaholic](https://taskaholic.com)
- 📊 [Stonk Advisor](https://stonkadvisor.com)

You can find me various places on the interwebs:
- 🖥️ [CurtisCodes.com - Windows98 Themed Portfolio](https://curtiscodes.com)
- 🐦 [Twitter - @curtiscodes](https://twitter.com/codescurtis)
- 🕴️ [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/dancurtis)

Occasionally, I write about programming on Dev.to:
